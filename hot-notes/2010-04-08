If G |-I M : sigma ~> e
And sigma ~> [a:k.t]

... GCs!

Copying
+ asymptotic performance is good
+ fragmentation avoided
+ (?) cache performance?


Mark-Sweep
+ can be conservatiave
+ portable
- asymptotic performance sucks
- fragmentation

Copying!
"White" = untouched
"grey" = partially copied
"black" = done

There are no pointers from black to white.
